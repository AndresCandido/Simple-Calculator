# Simple-Calculator

A collection of scripts for functions present in a simple calculator - made using the MIPS assembly language

## Features

- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations
- Well-commented MIPS assembly code for educational purposes
- Modular structure for easy extension and experimentation

## Getting Started

To run these scripts, you will need a MIPS assembler and simulator, such as [MARS](http://courses.missouristate.edu/kenvollmar/mars/) or [SPIM](https://spimsimulator.sourceforge.net/).

## Usage

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open the assembly files in your preferred MIPS simulator.
3. Assemble and run the code to use the calculator functions.

## License

This project is open-source and available for anyone interested in learning MIPS assembly or contributing improvements.
